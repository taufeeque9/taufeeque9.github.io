I am a research engineer at [FAR AI](https://far.ai/) working with Dr. [Adam Gleave](https://gleave.me/) on research projects at the intersection of reinforcement learning and natural language processing.
My current work is focused on interpretability research on large language models and benchmarking imitation learning algorithms. 

I graduated with a bachelors in  Computer Science from [IIT Bombay](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/). 
For my bachelors thesis, I worked with Prof. [Shivaram Kalyanakrishnan](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~shivaram/) to build Fianchetto, an AI agent for the game of Reconnaissance Blind Chess that won the [NeurIPS 2021 competition](https://rbc.jhuapl.edu/tournaments/33) on RBC.

I have also interned at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/) to work on incorporating phrasal rules with LLMs on-the-fly with Prof. [Sunita Sarawagi](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~sunita/) and Dr. [Sriram Rajamani](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/sriram/).
In the summer of 2020, I interned at the PLRI lab of [Technical University of Braunschweig, Germany](https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/en/) to work with Prof. [Thomas Deserno](https://www.plri.de/team/thomas-deserno) on human fall detection.
